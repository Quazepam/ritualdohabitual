I've noticed during my career that I'm some kind of information hoarder. I save every interesting link in a bookmark, every Office Lens photo in Onenote, and every piece of documentation in a folder somewhere. This has served me well multiple times, either for myself or for sharing with a colleagues.
Thank goodness for the search function that let's me recover info fast in an as needed basis. However, the truth is that most of the info I save will not be read again.
