Hey there, my name's André Sucena and I'm a 30-something Portuguese industrial engineer turned SAP functional consultant. I envisioned pirHANA — short for projects, implementations, and reviews in S/4HANA — in 2019 as a consulting business/expert blog specialized in SAP logistics and general logistic processes.

## Short bio

I majored in Management and Industrial Engineering back in 2013 and have worked in logistics some way or another ever since. I had the good fortune of working as a logistics manager in a company which was very focused in implementing Lean Manufacturing methodologies at the time. This would have a profound influence in my future work as a consultant. I used that company's mature SAP ECC system extensively. Eventually I decided to become a SAP consultant myself.

### Life as a consultant

I started working as a SAP consultant in a prestigious consulting company and stayed there for almost 2 years, during which I've specialized in Sales and distribution (SD) and Materials Management / Purchasing (MM) in S/4HANA environments. During my experience there I've had the opportunity of working with several clients in different project stages and even complete one full lifecycle implementation. Besides SD and MM, I've also become an expert in Transportation (LE-TRA), Settlement Management (LO-AB), and Advanced Returns Management (LO-ARM). As of 2019, I'm assigned to an Oil and Gas company as a general consultant, where I've broadened my skills to FICO and got much better at debugging issues and specifying ABAP developments because of the developers being outsourced.

## Bottomline

If you are searching for a young professional who has vast know-how on the supply chain on both sides of the table, and how things can be achieved in SAP, and that will support you in implementing SAP solutions, then contact me at pirHANA and I'll be happy to help you achieve your goals for your company.
